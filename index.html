                <hr>
                <h2>Hello first my name is justus Panitz and I am 15 years old, I have been working in Java development for 2 years, in C# development for 1 year and as a basic web developer for 3 years. I have implemented many projects and am always looking forward to new challenges. I have worked in different companies and projects as a developer or as a backend developer. Currently I am building my own project called AlternateSystems, in this project I bring several developers together and work together on a specific project. These projects are then sold online and the developers who worked on the project receive the money. I myself don't get paid if I don't work with them.  I hope I have aroused your interest and would be happy if you would contact me for a project or collaboration on a project. </h2>
